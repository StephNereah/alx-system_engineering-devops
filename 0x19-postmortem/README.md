#Issue Summary

**Duration:**   August 15, 2024, 10:00 AM - August 15, 2024, 11:30 AM UTC
	
**Impact:**   During the 1.5-hour Nginx-induced nap, about 75% of users were left staring at a 502 Bad Gateway error instead of enjoying our lovely web application. It was like sending your guests to a party where the host forgot to show up—awkward and disappointing. Thankfully, only 75% of our users got stuck outside the party, but that's still too many.

**Root Cause:**   The culprit was a tiny, seemingly insignificant semicolon, or rather the lack of one. This rogue missing punctuation led to an Nginx configuration breakdown, making it impossible for our application to do its job. Who knew that a missing dot and a squiggle could bring down the house?


##Timeline

- **10:00AM:** Nginx decides it's time for a coffee break, triggering an alert about increased response times. 

- **10:05AM**:  Engineer on-call reviewed the alert and noticed multiple 502 Bad Gateway errors in the logs.

- **10:10 AM:** The backend servers get all the blame initially, but they're innocent this time—smooth as butter.

- **10:20 AM:** Further investigation revealed that the backend servers were functioning correctly, but requests were not reaching them.

- **10:30 AM:** Misleading path checked the database for potential connection issues but found no anomalies.

- **10:40 AM:** The spotlight shifts to Nginx after a brief “aha!” moment. 

- **10:45 AM:** The missing semicolon is finally discovered in the Nginx config file. Mystery solved!

- **11:00 AM:** The Nginx configuration was corrected, and the service was restarted.

- **11:10 AM:** Web application services began to recover, and 502 errors ceased.

- **11:30 AM:** Full recovery achieved, and Nginx promises never to skip a semicolon again.


###Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause was a misconfigured Nginx file missing a semicolon at the end of a directive. This caused Nginx to throw a fit and refuse to forward requests, leading to widespread 502 errors.

**Resolution:**

- The configuration error was corrected by adding the missing semicolon. The Nginx service was then successfully restarted, restoring the application’s functionality. A syntax validation step was added to the deployment pipeline to catch similar errors in the future.

####Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Immediate Improvements:**

- Implemented a pre-deployment syntax check for Nginx configuration files.

- Added automated rollback for any future Nginx errors.


**Long-term Actions:**

- Conducted training sessions for engineers on proper configuration management and testing.

- Reviewed and updated the configuration management process to include peer review before deployment.

- Implemented additional monitoring and alerting for Nginx-specific errors to detect issues more rapidly.
